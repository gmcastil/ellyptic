Things which still need to be done:

- [X] Implement `R_F`
- [X] Implement `R_C`
- [ ] Implement `R_J`
- [ ] Implement `R_D`
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] Add support for NumPy style docstrings
- [ ] Module for calculating Legendre forms using Carlson forms
- [ ] Add tests using the Boost datasets: scipy/special/tests/data/boost

Once these are complete, I would like to try to introduce these into the SciPy
stack.
