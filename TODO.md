Things which still need to be done:

- [X] Implement R<sub>F</sub>
- [X] Implement R<sub>C</sub>
- [X] Implement R<sub>J</sub> - needs some work on the tests though.
- [ ] Implement R<sub>D</sub>
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] Add NumPy style docstrings
- [X] Add tests using the Boost datasets: scipy/special/tests/data/boost
- [ ] Module for calculating Legendre forms using Carlson forms

Once these are complete, I would like to try to introduce these into the SciPy
stack.
